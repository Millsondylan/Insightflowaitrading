# Ultra-Minimal Setup Guide for Lovable

This guide provides instructions for an extremely simplified deployment that will **always work** on Lovable, even if the main React application has issues.

## The Problem

If you're experiencing:
- White screens
- Failed builds
- Complex dependencies not resolving

## The Solution

We've created an ultra-minimal approach that bypasses the entire React build process:

1. A standalone Express server
2. A simple HTML page
3. No complex dependencies

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set up the project

```bash
# Run the setup script (from project root)
bash lovable-setup.sh
```

This will create a public directory with the minimal HTML page.

### 2. Configure Lovable

Configure your Lovable project with these settings:

- **Framework**: Node.js
- **Build Command**: `echo "No build step required for minimal setup"`
- **Start Command**: `npm run minimal-start`
- **Install Command**: `npm install express`
- **Node Version**: 18.x or higher

### 3. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait for the deployment to complete.

## How It Works

This approach:
1. Completely bypasses the Vite/React build process
2. Uses a simple Express server to serve a static HTML file
3. Has minimal dependencies (just Express)
4. Will always render properly

## Testing Locally

To test this approach locally:

```bash
# Set up the minimal deployment
bash lovable-setup.sh

# Install Express if needed
npm install express

# Start the minimal server
npm run minimal-start
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Next Steps

Once this minimal approach is working, you can investigate the React application issues by:

1. Checking the browser console for errors
2. Examining Lovable build logs
3. Trying to build the React app locally with `npm run build`

This approach is meant as a temporary solution while you diagnose and fix the main application.
