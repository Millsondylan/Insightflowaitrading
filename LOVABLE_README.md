# Insight Flow AI Trading - Lovable.dev Integration

This document provides an overview of the Insight Flow AI Trading platform's integration with Lovable.dev. The application has been optimized for Lovable.dev's visual editing capabilities and component architecture.

## üåü Features

### Visual Editing

The application supports Lovable.dev's Visual Edits feature, allowing precise modifications to components directly in the browser:

- **Component Selection**: Click on any component to edit its properties
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly as you make them
- **Tailwind Support**: Full support for Tailwind classes
- **Custom Styling**: Edit colors, typography, spacing and more
- **Direct Text Editing**: Modify text content with ease

### Tech Compatibility

The platform includes comprehensive tools for tech compatibility:

- **Component Converter**: Transform regular React components to Lovable.dev format
- **Next.js Migration**: Convert your Lovable React app to Next.js
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync your components with GitHub repositories
- **Supabase Adapter**: Connect to Supabase for backend functionality

## üìÅ File Structure

The application follows Lovable.dev's recommended file structure:

- **Regular Components**: `src/components/ComponentName.tsx`
- **Lovable Components**: `src/components/ComponentName.lovable.tsx`

All lovable-compatible components export a `lovable` object with metadata:

```tsx
export const lovable = {
  editableComponents: true,
  visualEditing: true,
  supportsTailwind: true
};
```

2. **Stable IDs**: Components use stable IDs for reliable selection
3. **Tailwind Classes**: Styling uses Tailwind for compatibility
4. **Metadata Export**: All components export metadata for the editor
5. **Visual Edit Hints**: Components include hints for better editing

## üîÑ Visual Edits Workflow

1. Select a component to edit
2. Modify properties in the right panel
3. Preview changes in real-time
4. Apply changes when satisfied
5. Changes are saved to the source code

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
